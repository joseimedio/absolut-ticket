### Exercise: Make a Slider

In this assignment you will be asked to create a bare-bones HTML/JS/CSS responsive slider. Given the HTML in `Coding/exercise-2/index.html`, use CSS and Javascript to create a functional interactive. 

You may use 3rd-party libraries as long as they are ES6/ES5-based javascript libraries (no jQuery). 

This assignment will be assessed on the following criteria:

- does the slider work?
- are the transitions smooth? 
- is it easy to use?

Feel free to get creative with how you style the slider, buttons, and pagination - but we are not assessing your design or creative abilities. 

**Requirements** 

- You must not edit any HTML in `index.html` (the only exception is you can remove the text from the prev/next buttons and pagination list items for the purpose of adjusting the appearance).
- The slider should loop (forwards and backwards)
- The pagination buttons should be clickable
- The prev/next buttons should work
- The slider should be functional on any size screen (and work with touch inputs)

**Submitting** 

Any files you create for this project should be placed into the specific folder along with any readme or instructions you wish to provide.
